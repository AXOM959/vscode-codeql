# CodeQL for Visual Studio Code: Changelog

## 1.0.3

- Reduce the frequency of CodeQL CLI update checks to help avoid hitting GitHub API limits of 60 requests per
hour for unauthenticated IPs.
- Fix sorting of result sets with names containing special characters.

## 1.0.2 - 13 December 2019

- Fix rendering of negative numbers in results.

  query history view context menu.
- Show number of results in results view.
- Add commands `CodeQL: Show Next Step on Path` and `CodeQL: Show

  shown path result.

## 1.0.1 - 21 November 2019
